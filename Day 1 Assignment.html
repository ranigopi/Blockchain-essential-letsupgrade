Q1)what is your understanding of Blockchain
Answer:
Blockchain is a system of recording
informationin a way that makes it
difficult or impossible to change,
hack, or cheat the system. 
A blockchainis essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.


Q2) what is core problem trying to solve??
Answer:
 1) Blockchain Addresses The Problem Of Data Loss Due To Hardware Or Connectivity Issues.
 2)  Blockchain Addresses The Problem Of Data Corruption Due To Intermittent Hardware Or Connectivity Issues.
 3)  Blockchain Addresses The Problem Of Data Security And Trust By Making The Ledger Public.
 4  Unscrupulous Agents Acting On Your Behalf.
 
 
 Q3)few features of Blockchain?
 Answer:
 1) cannot be corrupted.
 2) Decentralized Technology.
 3) Enhanced Security. 
 4) Distributed Ledgers. 
 5) Consensus. 
 6) Faster Settlement.
 
 
 Q4)all thing does a block contain?
 Answer:
1)Each block contains, among other things
the current time, a record of some or all recent transactions, and a reference to the block that came immediately before it.
2) It also contains an answer to a difficult-to-solve mathematical puzzle - the answer to which is unique to each block.
3) New blocks cannot be submitted to the network without the correct answer - the process of "mining" is essentially the process of competing to be the next to find the answer that "solves" the current block.
4)The mathematical problem in each block is extremely difficult to solve, but once a valid solution is found, it is very easy for the rest of the network to confirm that the solution is correct. 
 
 
 Q5)How is the verifiability of the Blockchain is been attained??
 Answer:
 1) As public ledgers, Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum require transactions to be visible by default.
 2) Ethereum network offers pseudo-anonymity; for example, transactions are linked to addresses that correspond to public keys derived by user-held private keys, not by username or password.
 3) Certain technologies are currently being developed and tested for Ethereum 2 and Ethereum 3 that add an enclave of privacy to public Ethereum, namely, zk-SNARKs.
 4) A zk-SNARK is a cryptographic proof system that allows users to maintain private transactions while validating the transactions according to the networkâ€™s consensus algorithm.
  5) Once zk-SNARKs is implemented, organizations
